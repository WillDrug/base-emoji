# base-emoji
Encoding and decoding functions, turning text into emoji;
Really inefficient, based on python codepoints and base512 system.

Should shorten text but doesn't, considering one UTF-8 character can be 4 bytes and emojis themselves are UTF-8;

Forks are welcome, send me a carrier pidgeon if you figure out how to actually shorten text (not just for latin\cyrillic, though).
